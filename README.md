# 👉 About me!

I am pentester and cybersecurity consultant passionate about hacking and offensive security. I am certified in CEHv12 (Certified Ethical Hacker) EC-Council. I am proactive in learning and I am always trying new techniques and expanding my knowledge.

# 🚀 Projects

📌 Tools - Scripts:
  - rogue-https-server.py: https server with python 3.10/3.11 for incoming TLS encrypted communications and checks of Out-of-bands attacks. Amoong features: free DNS and auto generating pem. Checks vulnerabilities like: External Service Interaction (DNS, HTTP), blind SSRF, REC PHP, XSS Stored with cookies exfiltration, Out-of-band SQL injection (OOB SQLi), Server Security Miscofiguration, among others.
  - awsbugseeker: script for testing on AWS cloud apps.
  - lootXploits: bash script for find exploits for exposed services.

📌 Medium posts - My actual blog for hacking posts.
